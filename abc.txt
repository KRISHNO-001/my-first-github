hi
this is me
krishno gopal das  
I am an Indian  and  an engineer by profession , am born and brought up in a village
in west bengal named  rupnarayanpur , which is a small  village on the outskirts of the 
rail city  Chittaranjan which has contributed our country India to gain honor and pride
for being capable to produce railway locomotives for it own needs
and  also for other developing nations , as you may  have  guessed that city had been 
named after Chittaranjan Das who shaded his blood and sweat 
for the independence from british rule in the late 50s 
under the observence of the Dr.bidhanchandra roy who cheif minister of west bengal in that time
there is no need to introduce him, nobody is unknown to his divine  skills as a physician ,
national doctors day on 1st july  his celebrated on his memory , he has been awared bharat ratna 
was also an active leader in civil disobedience movement , all the pennies  paid by the citizens to government 
in form of tax were spent on building 
cities like Chittaranjan,Durgapur,kolkata,Asansol that provide livelihood to millions of people 
still now after being repeatedly looted by the political scamsters . 
Modern politicians  has changed the definition of development and  sacrifice as per them
they are born in the age of globalization so they more proficient business  
but unfortunately they are flollowing hitlers model
